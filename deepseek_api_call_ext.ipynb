    "Code-switching and code-mixing refer to the intra- and inter-sentential alternation between two or more languages or language varieties within a single discourse. From a morphosyntactic perspective, these phenomena are governed by identifiable grammatical constraints that regulate where and how switching may occur without compromising grammaticality.\n",
    "One of the most widely cited constraints is the Equivalence Constraint (Poplack, 1980), which posits that code-switching tends to occur at points in discourse where the surface structures of both languages are congruent or share equivalent word order. This ensures that the syntactic rules of both languages are respected, avoiding ungrammatical constructions. For example, in Spanish-English switching, a switch between “I saw her en la tienda” is permissible, as both English and Spanish permit a noun phrase in post-verbal object position. However, switching within a compound verb or at a point where constituent order differs cross-linguistically is often blocked.\n",
    "The Matrix Language Frame Model (Myers-Scotton, 1993) further formalizes this by distinguishing between a matrix language (ML) and an embedded language (EL). The ML provides the morphosyntactic frame of the sentence, determining word order, functional morphology, and system morphemes, while content morphemes (lexical items) may be inserted from the EL. Importantly, system morphemes (such as inflectional affixes or function words) are typically drawn from the ML, due to their language-specific syntactic dependencies.\n",
    "Another critical constraint is the Functional Head Constraint (Belazi, Rubin, and Toribio, 1994), which restricts switching between a functional head (e.g., determiner, complementizer, tense) and its complement. For instance, switching between a determiner and noun in languages with differing determiner-noun agreement systems (e.g., French-English: “the voiture”) is less acceptable than switching at noun phrase boundaries.\n",
    "In addition, morphological compatibility is essential; bound morphemes rarely cross language boundaries. A switch is generally not allowed when a morpheme from one language would attach to a root from another. This holds especially for fusional languages, where morphology is tightly integrated with syntax.\n",
    "Cross-linguistically, typological similarity between the languages involved influences the range of acceptable switch points. For instance, in VSO languages (e.g., Arabic) versus SVO languages (e.g., English), constituent structure mismatches constrain the syntactic loci where switches may occur. Nonetheless, bilingual speakers develop internalized rules that allow them to exploit structurally congruent points of alignment for switching, creating hybrid constructions that remain grammatically well-formed within both systems.\n",
